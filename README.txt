Apache 2.4 Server Launcher

Used to start/stop unnamed default HTTP server. Closing the tool will stop the HTTP server.

If you only want the tool and not the source, all you need is the exe and two batch files from the root.

The batch files are configured to run Apache from the default directory of C:\Apache24\bin
